# Fleefie's advent of code repository!

### Compiling:

    make

This will compile every file named main.c into a file named main.out in
the same directory.

You may clean up the executables with:

    make clean

To test the output of the code:

    make test

This will directly compare the output of the executable with a file named
answer.txt next to it.
